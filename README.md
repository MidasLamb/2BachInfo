# Helping
Feel free to contribute to this repository!
I'm not that good with Latex, so changing some stupid stuff i did is also very welcome.

#Guidelines
* Since we're ICT students, try to use .tex-files as much as possible.
* Please keep everything structured.
* If you contribute, don't forget to add your name to the list (see below).
* Only add pdf's that are not generated from tex files in here, the .gitignore includes .pdf, so if you want to add a .pdf, you must change the .gitignore at the root (other .gitignores are only to make the directory-structure appear on git).

#How to use the submodules:
If you fork/clone this repository, you will find that the directories for the submodules are empty. To solve this, run "git submodule init" in the submodule directory and then "git submodule update".
