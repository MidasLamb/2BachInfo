#About Principles of Economics for Scientists
A summary/course notes collection in Latex is currently being worked on at [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/project/56239aff652e7ed02a181c63)

A snapshot of the document after the last class has been added to this repo, but a lot of sections are incomplete and the document needs to be checked for consistency and spelling mistakes.
For the latest version, refer to the ShareLatex project linked above.

#IMPORTANT NOTE 
When compiling the snapshot on your own machine, you will need to use the [XeLaTex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX) compiler.
(confirmed working a with a Miktex + Texmaker install on Windows)

Major credits go to Michael Vanderstuyft, who took most notes during classes and who created most of the figures.
